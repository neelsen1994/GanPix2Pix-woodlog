# Enhancing Wood Log Surface Quality for Siamese Network-Based Identification Using Pix2Pix GAN

This project addresses a critical challenge in the wood processing industry â€“ the accurate identification of wood logs despite damage and variations caused by processing conditions. This innovative work leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, specifically Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to transform degraded wood log images into pristine representations which enhances the visibility of the annual ring patterns for identification. The resulting enhanced images are then seamlessly integrated into a Siamese Network for precise and reliable wood log identification.

## Dataset Notice

Please note that the dataset used in this project is proprietary and owned by a company client of Fraunhofer IPM. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide public access to the dataset due to legal and confidentiality agreements. The focus of this repository is to showcase the code, methodology, and results derived from the dataset.

This is a test output after training the model with the company dataset from the forest and the test image is obtained from Google.
